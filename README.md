# jQuery Work Day Scheduler

<!-- omit in toc -->
## Description

This is a simple calendar app powered by jQuery that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, and each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. User can enter an event into a time block and save it in local storage, which will persist on page load.
